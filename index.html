        Ayy, ooh, ayy, ooh
        Ayy, ooh, ayy, ooh
        Ayy, ooh, ayy, ooh
        Ah, ah, ah

        What's your superpower?
        Show me what you're made of
        I been lonely for days and days
        But we're one and the same
        Pardon my superstition
        But with my supervision
        I see so much of myself
        My past, my pain, my pride and my ego

        But I see no evil
        I see no evil
        I see another reason for me to believe in the hero

        Can you breathe underwater?
        Should I dive any deeper?
        What's the name you want me to call you whenever I need you?
        Are you here to get even?
        Must be here for a reason
        No point in tellin' the truth when you're bulletproof
        And nobody cares to believe you

        But, baby, I see you
        And I see no evil (I see no evil)
        I see another reason for me to believe in the hero

        Watch 'em switch up
        No one rollin' with you, yeah
        New position, move too fast, you gon' miss it, yeah
        Intermission is over once you hit the light (ah, ah, ah, ah)

        Ayy, ooh, ayy, ooh
        Ayy, ooh, ayy, ooh
        Ayy, ooh, ayy, ooh
